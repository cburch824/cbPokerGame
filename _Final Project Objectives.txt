At the moment, the game does not evaluate hands or determine a winner (clsEvaluateHand.cs is not quite complete and thus has
not been implemented). However, it does deal cards to every player and fufill the requirements accordingly:


-Menu Control:
There is a menu strip on frmMainMenu

-Any two of the following:
1. Comboboxes are used to select players on frmMainMenu.
2. Color dialogs are used on frmMainMenu to choose the color of the board and the fonts on the board.

-MessageBox:
MessageBoxes are used under the try-catch blocks in frmMainMenu, under the method titled readStatsFromFile(Character c, string s). 
Location: (frmMainMenu.cs, Line 94)

-Decision Structure:
If-if else- else decision structure is used under the Hand class. It is used to determine hand strength.
